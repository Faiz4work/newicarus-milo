                            Volunteers with financial expertise are always in demand by non-profits. Volunteering is an excellent way to enhance your CV by learning new skills, building a broader network and enabling you to ‘stand out from the crowd’. On top of that, there is the feel-good factor! At Eximius/Charterpath we aim to chart a path between accountants and the non-profit sector to inspire accountants to give their time and expertise to a cause they care about and make it easier for non-profits to recruit high-quality volunteers from a diverse range of backgrounds.
                            <div class=""mt-4 font-weight-bold ""></div>
                            <p>Non-profits face unprecedented challenges as a result of the pandemic – 1 in 3 charities made redundancies in 2020, 83% forecast reduced income in 2021 and 1 in 10 warning of potential failure. At the same time 75% are experiencing increased demand for their services.  Every non-profit needs individuals with financial expertise – whether on a part-time or full-time basis or in an oversight role. The average trustee is white, male, between the ages of 55-64 with above average education and income.</p> <p> </p> <p>Charterpath is a charitable initiative aimed at 'charting a path' between accountants and the non-profit sector. We are looking to <strong>inspire </strong>more accountants into volunteering, to <strong>connect </strong>them with relevant non-profit opportunities (and a wider volunteer network) and <strong>engage </strong>with third parties such as accounting institutes / corporates to embed volunteering as a status-quo from accounting trainees up until retirement. We hope this will make it easier for non-profits to source and recruit high quality volunteers with financial skills and also improve the diversity of such volunteers. </p> <p> </p> <p>You cannot underestimate the benefits of volunteering to the individual as well as the non-profit. Serving as a trustee is a great opportunity to learn new skills and gain experience of a Board or Executive Committee. You will also build a great network to support future career development. Most importantly, volunteering is a chance to feel good from making a difference and there are also proven benefits for mental health.</p>

                            <b>Our team:</b> <br> Bloomberg Portfolio Analytics (or PORT) empowers the most prominent players in the financial world to manage their portfolios, assess exposures, and make decisions that move the financial markets. Our flagship product on the Bloomberg Professional service is a critical tool used daily by money managers, mutual funds, hedge funds, and pension funds around the world. <br> <br> We are responsible for a number of enterprise products in London which come with complex challenges to solve: <br> <br> 1. JMGR (owned by the Portfolio Batching team): a workflow management and batch reporting tool used by large institutional and enterprise clients to manage their portfolios, run reports, and consume PORT analytics in an automated fashion. <br> <br> 2. Tickerization (owned by the Tickerization team): a process for representing custom portfolios as individual securities and making them first-class entities in the Bloomberg Terminal. The process allows clients to maintain complex portfolio graphs to mimic how large funds maintain their asset hierarchies. <br> <br> 3. ARME (owned by the Enterprise Infrastructure team) - a permissioning system foundational to the entire PORT infrastructure that provides access control to and enables sharing of PORT objects among different groups <br> <br> 4. Orchestration (owned by the Orchestration team) - a framework for workflow definition, execution, introspection and management. It specialises on the longer asynchronous workflows that cross products and outlive single process lifetimes. <br> <br> 5. Portfolio Interface (owned by the Portfolio Interface team) - a service based API for running portfolio computations. The API provides a uniform interface to enable many different products to run portfolio computations across Bloomberg. It is responsible for query planning and executing computations with low latency and high throughput. <br> <br> The common challenge for our area is meeting the scaling requirements of our highly distributed systems, such as ARME's 700+ million daily requests, Tickerization's 200k tickers, and JMGR's 300k daily reports. <br> <br> <b>Who are you?</b> <br> An experienced developer with interest in distributed systems who enjoys working closely with business and clients, and loves the challenge of transforming the current system! <br> <br> <b>We'll trust you to:</b> <br> <ul> <li> Take ownership of the full development cycle and collaborate with the team on design and implementation</li> <li> Partner with clients and other developers to design, build and roll-out solutions that will optimize complex workflows</li> <li> Explore new technologies both within and outside of Bloomberg to determine if they can help make our products run faster, increase stability, etc.</li> <li> Embrace working together as a team - mentoring and learning from their existing teammates to break knowledge silos and ensure that our team is producing reliable, well documented and well understood products for our clients</li> </ul> <br> <b>You will need to have:</b> <br> <ul> <li> Proven experience in an OOP language, ideally Python and/or C++</li> <li> Experience covering the full software development life cycle</li> <li> Interest in working in an application facing team</li> <li> Understanding of distributed systems challenges e.g. prioritization, throttling, failure recovery</li> <li> Pragmatic problem-solving skills</li> </ul> <br> <b>We'd love to see:</b> <br> <ul> <li> Interest in understanding our products and processes</li> <li> Experience in large distributed systems</li> </ul> <br> <b>Interview process:</b> <br> We believe interviewing is a two way street.

                            <strong>Your opportunity</strong> <br> <strong>Site Reliability Testing is an evolving practice focused on applying Quality Engineering to the rollout of SRE tools, processes and changes. </strong>For example, adoption of monitoring services in all test environments as well as production, to gain early sight of reliability issues and service level objective breaches before any impact to users. <br> <strong>Business Operations </strong> <br>Want to work with the latest technologies, as part of a team helping international organisations transform their core business capabilities? Whether you're working with on-premise systems, Cloud technology, or custom-developed solutions (to name just a few), your expertise will help clients deliver continuous improvement and innovation, from initial design right through to implementation and optimization. <br> <strong>Your role</strong> <br>Site Reliability Engineering focusses on areas such as automation, efficiency and reliability to deliver quality. As a site reliability tester within our Quality and Test Engineering team some of the key questions you will help to answer for our clients would be: <br> • How reliable is the system? <br>• How can we measure and quantify this reliability? <br>• What automated responses can be put in place to proactively handle known exceptions and incidents and adopt a self-healing approach? <br>• How confident are we that the reliability is not compromised by a change being delivered? <br>• How can we test and assure that the SRE requirements will be met before a production change is implemented? <br> <br> Site reliability testers are naturally inquisitive and test the full stack of the application under test, from infrastructure through to the front end, protecting the user's digital experience from outages and ensuring large-scale, distributed systems are observable, manageable and fault-tolerant. <br> SRTs should think creatively and apply the latest tools and techniques including chaos engineering and digital experience monitoring. Working collaboratively with our clients and engineering teams you will help promote and embed reliability engineering throughout our programmes. <br> <br> <strong>Your work, your choice</strong> <br>At Deloitte we believe the best impact is the value we add, not the hours we sit at our desk.

We are aiming to increase the volume of data we have for those markets by orders of magnitude and need talented engineers to understand the full scope of what we, as a business, are trying to achieve, and come up with creative solutions.

The product forms the backbone of a trader's workflow across many trading products.
